## Notice ##
This project is, in my eyes, abandoned. I did it for fun several years back,
but it does not stack up against other timezone libraries, and I have abandoned
it. Use at your own risk!


A python tool for automatically generating a module containing datetime.tzinfo
objects for most major timezones. The data source is the zoneinfo database
provided by IANA here:

http://www.iana.org/time-zones

KNOWN ISSUES:
A few rules are inconsistantly provided in UTC times, which means that they may
be inaccurate for a few hours around changes.
